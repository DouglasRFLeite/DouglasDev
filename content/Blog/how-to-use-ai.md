Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing software development. It's up to us to decide if that revolution of for the better or worse.

AI helps debug errors, explain messy code, generate unit tests, and even teach complex concepts. But if you’re not careful, it can also turn into a crutch—or worse, a trap.

I've seen junior developers blindly copy-paste AI-generated code into their (and even my) projects, only to spend hours later trying to fix the mess. So, how do you actually use AI the right way? Let’s break it down.

## 1. Use AI to Understand Errors (Not Just Fix Them)

We've all been there: staring at an error message that might as well be written in an alien language. Instead of Googling for hours, AI can analyze the error and provide a clear explanation, find where the erros is actually happening, and sometimes even with suggested fixes.

But here’s the catch: don’t just take the solution and run. Understand why the error happened in the first place. That’s how you actually grow as a developer.

## 2. Decode Messy or Legacy Code

Ever had to maintain an ancient codebase that looks like it was written by a sleep-deprived intern a decade ago? AI can help decipher that cryptic logic, explaining what different functions do and even suggesting refactors.

It’s like having a senior dev by your side—except this one won’t judge your coding habits (or your excessive use of print statements for debugging).

## 3. Learn New Concepts Faster

AI isn’t just a debugging tool; it’s also an amazing learning companion. Struggling with a new framework? Stuck on a design pattern? Ask an AI for an explanation, examples, or even analogies to make it click.

The trick is to use AI as a mentor, not a shortcut. Otherwise, you’ll end up with code you don’t actually understand—and that’s a ticking time bomb waiting to explode.

## 4. Automate Unit Test Generation (But Don’t Skip Review!)

Writing tests can be tedious, and AI can speed up the process by generating unit tests automatically. This is a game-changer for improving code coverage without spending hours writing boilerplate tests.

However, AI isn’t perfect. Always review and tweak the generated tests to ensure they make sense for your application’s logic.

Remember! Unit tests are not meant to provide coverage. They are meant to test business logic, coverage is just a metric. See if the test actually covers what you want it to, specially the problematic edge-cases.

## 5. Never Copy-Paste Without Understanding

This is specially to those using AI to solve a problem they can't. Copy-pasting AI-generated code without understanding it is like using a chainsaw without reading the manual—dangerous and almost guaranteed to cause problems. 

Ask AI how to do it. Use the generate code. But before integrating AI-generated solutions, make sure you fully grasp what they do and how they fit into your existing code. Don't just stuff it inside the file.

## 6. Don’t Restructure Your Code to Fit AI’s Output

Your architecture should drive your code, not the other way around. If AI suggests a solution that forces you to make unnatural changes to your structure, take a step back. It’s probably better to tweak the AI prompt or refine the generated code than to compromise your architecture.

I've seen interns copy and paste GPT code and submiting it o review just because it worked, even though it complety stod out from the rest of the architecture. Don't do that.

## 7. People Know Better

If it's an important decision. If it's critical code. If you looked at the generated code and could not understand it at all. Call a senior. 

Software Development got this far without AI, we can keep living without it. We shouldn't, it's an awesome tool if used right. But we can. 

So if you're a more junior developer, or even a mid-level, and you have any uncertanty about using AI to finish your task, as a more senior developer, we will either answer you better or, at least, know how to use AI in order to solve your problem.

### Final Thoughts

AI is a powerful tool that can supercharge your productivity—but only if you use it wisely. The best developers don’t rely on AI to do their thinking for them. They use it to accelerate learning, improve efficiency, and enhance code quality without sacrificing understanding.

What’s your experience with AI in coding? Have you found it to be a game-changer or a headache?
