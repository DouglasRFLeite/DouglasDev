I’ve always been a writer—well, except for that one time in freshman year when my teacher gave me a 3 out of 10 in an essay. Yeah, dark times.

But aside from that, I used to write poems as a teenager (never shared them, though), fiction as a kid, and I loved crafting DnD campaigns in my early 20s.

Technical writing found me around 2022, when I was trying to break into Data Science and everyone kept saying, _"You need a Medium blog to share what you learn."_

Well... I’m not a Data Scientist.

Instead, I got into Software Engineering (I have a bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering), and I love it. But that writing idea stuck with me.

I tried going back to Medium with some articles, but it didn’t really work out. Then I started writing quick posts on LinkedIn, and I genuinely enjoyed it. Now, I want to take the next step.

## **Why a Website?**

I could skip this entire section and just tell you to watch [this Ali Abdaal video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWfIrmIgaCU&ab_channel=AliAbdaal).

But I’ll give you my take as well—it’ll be quicker than watching the whole thing.

According to Ali Abdaal, a productivity YouTuber I’ve been following for a while, having a personal website serves three main purposes:

### **1 - Personal CV**

First, it works as a personal CV—a place to showcase your work and tell your story. It may sound similar to a well-optimized LinkedIn profile, and in some ways, it is. But it’s also **so much more**.

Your website lets you share projects, ideas, and experiences in ways LinkedIn or a PDF résumé never could.

When companies hire, they don’t just care about your professional achievements—they care about _you_. And a Personal Website is a perfect way to tell them about _you_.

**But most importantly**, even if none of that mattered, having a personal website makes you **stand out** from the competition.

### **2 - Personal Branding**

A website is your playground. You can shape your own _About Me_ page, add pictures, write blog posts—whatever reflects your personality and expertise. It’s the perfect foundation for building your personal brand.

### **3 - The Lucky Magnet**

Putting yourself out there increases your chances of attracting unexpected opportunities.

Nothing just falls into your lap—but something _might_ fall into your website.

## **Why a Blog?**

Technically, I didn’t _have_ to start a blog to get the benefits of a personal website.

But I _wanted_ to.

I needed a space to share knowledge and put all these ideas running through my mind out into the world.

Yes, it helps with personal branding. But more than that, it satisfies my urge to write.

## **How?**

I’ve written a lot about _why_ I started this blog. But if I’m being honest, about 50% of the motivation was just to test out Hugo.

I’d heard about this Golang-based tool that generates static web pages from Markdown files, and I had to try it. Golang is on my _to-learn_ list (somewhere around #54), so I figured I’d kill two birds with one stone.

I built everything using this video as a guide: [How to build a portfolio website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sm3IuE7zkYQ&t=3216s&ab_channel=DataProfessor). However, I prefer Vercel over Hostinger, so I deployed it here instead.

If you watch the tutorial, you’ll see that you don’t actually need to know any Go—so yeah, I’ll still need to get around to learning it someday.

## **What to Expect from This Blog?**

Content. Lots of content.

I love writing, and I hope this space gives me even more opportunities to do so.

I’ll mostly write about software—that’s my biggest passion, right after God and my amazing wife. Some of my posts will be technical and advanced, but I’ll also aim to share knowledge for beginners, enthusiasts, and professionals alike.

Beyond software, I’ve been diving into productivity and organization this year (2024–2025, for those reading this later).

I’m also learning about management, hoping to climb a few steps in my career, so I may write about that too.

More than anything, this blog will be a more structured, audience-focused version of my _Second Brain_.

## **Why You?**

So far, I’ve talked a lot about why I created this personal website. But why should _you_ create one?

Well, Ali Abdaal explains it better than I ever could. And I genuinely believe in everything he says.

But most importantly, you should **just start something**.

Stop overthinking, stop dreaming about it—just do it, even if it’s not exactly what you envisioned.

It took me about an hour to set this up once I found the right tutorial. Try it yourself. See how easy it is to put something out there when you want to.

You’ll see how empowering it can be.
