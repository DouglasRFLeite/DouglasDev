A few years ago, I used to believe that growth came from big, dramatic changes.

A major career move, learning an entirely new programming language overnight, or making a complete overhaul of my daily routine. I thought that if I wasn’t making big moves, I wasn’t moving forward at all.

Then, I stumbled upon **Kaizen**—a Japanese philosophy that completely changed the way I approach my work, my career, and my personal development.

### What is Kaizen?

**Kaizen** (改善) is a Japanese term that means "_change for the better._" Not necessarily huge changes, but steady, consistent improvement. It’s a philosophy of continuous progress, focusing on making small, incremental advancements rather than relying on disruptive changes.

The idea was born in post-war Japan to optimize manufacturing processes, but it has since been adopted in software development, business and evenl personal growth.

The core idea? Tiny improvements, repeated daily, compound into massive results over time. The thought that improving just **1% every day** leads to being **37 times** better at the end of a year.

I started applying Kaizen to different aspects of my life, and here’s how it transformed my approach to software development, career growth, and personal productivity.

## Kaizen in Software Development

If you’re a developer, you’ve likely also faced this dilemma: the codebase is a mess, technical debt is piling up, and you feel completely overwhelmed.

The instinctive response? “_We need a full refactor._” But we both know that is not likely to happen any time soon.

Kaizen showed me a better way: **small, continuous improvements**.

- Instead of rewriting an entire module, I started refactoring _one function at a time_.

- Rather than waiting for a big redesign, I introduced _incremental code quality improvements_ every sprint.

- When changing the architecture of a software, I stopped trying to do everything at once and instead committed to applying _just one key concept per day_.

The result? The codebase improved gradually but significantly. The overwhelming feeling faded, and technical debt was addressed without disrupting the entire project.

## Kaizen in Career Growth

For the longest time, I believed that career growth meant making giant leaps—landing a huge promotion, switching to a high-paying job, or gaining a prestigious certification.

But the reality is, _those things don’t really happen overnight_. Specially when you, like me, don't have 4 or 5 free hours a day to work on those improvements.

Applying Kaizen to my career meant focusing on consistent, small actions that built up over time:

- I started by making a weekly post on LinkedIn. Then, I increased to three posts a week. Now, you’re reading a blog post I wrote.

- I squeezed in 30 minutes of study during my commute. Six months later, I’m almost finishing my MBA. More on that here: [My 2025 Learning Roadmap](/blog/study-roadmap-2025).

- I was never a LeetCode guy but I have been improving over time with just 2 exercises a week.

Fast forward, and these small habits led to even more tangible results.

Ever since I started these small habits, I've landed better opportunities, became more confident in my skills, and even moved into a leadership role—without needing a dramatic career shift.

Yes, 30 minutes a day and 2 LeetCodes a week might seem small. Could it be more? Of course. But it’s still infinitely better than nothing. That’s the essence of Kaizen.

## Kaizen in Productivity

Beyond software development and career growth, Kaizen has also helped me improve my personal life—step by step.

At the start of 2025, I went down a YouTube rabbit hole on productivity and self-improvement. That’s when Kaizen caught my attention and became a guiding principle for me.

The key was adopting small, achievable habits rather than overwhelming myself with unrealistic goals like reading 100 books—at least when that is 98 more than the last year.

- I started 30-minute workouts **every day** during lunch—not ideal, but more than zero.

- I experimented with different note-taking and to-do list systems.

- I committed to doing **at least one** thoughtful thing for my wife daily—hopefully more, but at least one.

It's small stuff.

It's probably less then what I should do.

But, be honest, are you doing everything as you should? **Progress, even if slow, is better than standing still.** That's Kaizen!

## The Power of Small Steps

Kaizen isn’t about making huge sacrifices or waiting for the perfect moment. It’s about **taking small, intentional steps every day toward improvement**.

Whether you’re a developer trying to clean up a messy codebase, a professional looking to advance in your career, or someone struggling to find time for self-improvement—**start small**.

Improve one function in your code **today**.

Send one networking message **this week**.

Read one page of a book **tonight**.

Over time, these small steps will add up to something remarkable.
