I thought that if I wasn’t making big moves, I wasn’t moving forward at all.\nThen, I stumbled upon Kaizen—a Japanese philosophy that completely changed the way I approach my work, my career, and my personal development.\nWhat is Kaizen? Kaizen (改善) is a Japanese term that means “change for the better.” Not necessarily huge changes, but steady, consistent improvement. It’s a philosophy of continuous progress, focusing on making small, incremental advancements rather than relying on disruptive changes.\nThe idea was born in post-war Japan to optimize manufacturing processes, but it has since been adopted in software development, business and evenl personal growth.\nThe core idea? Tiny improvements, repeated daily, compound into massive results over time. The thought that improving just 1% every day leads to being 37 times better at the end of a year.\nI started applying Kaizen to different aspects of my life, and here’s how it transformed my approach to software development, career growth, and personal productivity.\nKaizen in Software Development If you’re a developer, you’ve likely also faced this dilemma: the codebase is a mess, technical debt is piling up, and you feel completely overwhelmed.\nThe instinctive response? “We need a full refactor.” But we both know that is not likely to happen any time soon.\nKaizen showed me a better way: small, continuous improvements.\nInstead of rewriting an entire module, I started refactoring one function at a time.\nRather than waiting for a big redesign, I introduced incremental code quality improvements every sprint.\nWhen changing the architecture of a software, I stopped trying to do everything at once and instead committed to applying just one key concept per day.\nThe result? The codebase improved gradually but significantly. The overwhelming feeling faded, and technical debt was addressed without disrupting the entire project.\nKaizen in Career Growth For the longest time, I believed that career growth meant making giant leaps—landing a huge promotion, switching to a high-paying job, or gaining a prestigious certification.\nBut the reality is, those things don’t really happen overnight. Specially when you, like me, don’t have 4 or 5 free hours a day to work on those improvements.\nApplying Kaizen to my career meant focusing on consistent, small actions that built up over time:\nI started by making a weekly post on LinkedIn. Then, I increased to three posts a week. Now, you’re reading a blog post I wrote.\nI squeezed in 30 minutes of study during my commute. Six months later, I’m almost finishing my MBA. More on that here: My 2025 Learning Roadmap.\nI was never a LeetCode guy but I have been improving over time with just 2 exercises a week.\nFast forward, and these small habits led to even more tangible results.\nEver since I started these small habits, I’ve landed better opportunities, became more confident in my skills, and even moved into a leadership role—without needing a dramatic career shift.\nYes, 30 minutes a day and 2 LeetCodes a week might seem small. Could it be more? Of course. But it’s still infinitely better than nothing. That’s the essence of Kaizen.\nKaizen in Productivity Beyond software development and career growth, Kaizen has also helped me improve my personal life—step by step.\nAt the start of 2025, I went down a YouTube rabbit hole on productivity and self-improvement. That’s when Kaizen caught my attention and became a guiding principle for me.\nThe key was adopting small, achievable habits rather than overwhelming myself with unrealistic goals like reading 100 books—at least when that is 98 more than the last year.\nI started 30-minute workouts every day during lunch—not ideal, but more than zero.\nI experimented with different note-taking and to-do list systems.\nI committed to doing at least one thoughtful thing for my wife daily—hopefully more, but at least one.\nIt’s small stuff.\nIt’s probably less then what I should do.\nBut, be honest, are you doing everything as you should? Progress, even if slow, is better than standing still. That’s Kaizen!\nThe Power of Small Steps Kaizen isn’t about making huge sacrifices or waiting for the perfect moment. It’s about taking small, intentional steps every day toward improvement.\nWhether you’re a developer trying to clean up a messy codebase, a professional looking to advance in your career, or someone struggling to find time for self-improvement—start small.\nImprove one function in your code today.\nSend one networking message this week.\nRead one page of a book tonight.\nOver time, these small steps will add up to something remarkable.\nFor more insights, software development and productivity content, follow up for more posts here in my blog and let us connect in LinkedIn!\n","wordCount":"807","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/images/cool-setup-002.jpeg","datePublished":"2025-02-21T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-02-21T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Douglas"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/blog/lifechanging-kaizen/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"DouglasDev","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/images/code-icon.png"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/blog/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/projects/ title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li><li><a href=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/contact/ title=Contact><span>Contact</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/blog/>Blogs</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">How this Japanese Philosophy Changed My Life</h1><div class=post-description>How the Kaizen Philosophy can change your life for the better, one day at a time</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-02-21 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 21, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;807 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Douglas</div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=eager src=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/images/cool-setup-002.jpeg alt="Cool Setup"><p>Unfortunetly not my setup</p></figure><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#what-is-kaizen>What is Kaizen?</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#kaizen-in-software-development>Kaizen in Software Development</a></li><li><a href=#kaizen-in-career-growth>Kaizen in Career Growth</a></li><li><a href=#kaizen-in-productivity>Kaizen in Productivity</a></li><li><a href=#the-power-of-small-steps>The Power of Small Steps</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>A few years ago, I used to believe that growth came from big, dramatic changes.</p><p>A major career move, learning an entirely new programming language overnight, or making a complete overhaul of my daily routine.
