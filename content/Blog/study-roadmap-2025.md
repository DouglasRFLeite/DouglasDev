At the beginning of each year, I like to set clear learning goals to push myself further as a software engineer. But if there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs that a **vague goal without a structured plan is just wishful thinking.**

That‚Äôs why, instead of saying ‚Äú_I want to get better at Java‚Äù_ or ‚Äú_I should learn cloud computing_,‚Äù I've broken my learning into focused, quarterly goals that align with my daily routine.

## My Daily Routine

Yes, you can plan to study 4-5h a day, nothing stops you from doing it. And few may even acomplish that, wich is fenomenal! But I can't, and I believe most of you can't neither.

So, troughout the last couple of years, I've realised I have 3 moments of my day that I can squeeze in some studying:

- **Hands-on coding at work** (1h-1h30 daily): My company motivates us to spend 1h to 1h30 every day for studying, it's a time block I like to separate for deeper, hands-on coding study.
- **Watching lectures** (30-45m in transit): While driving to and back to work, I found that I can listen to up to 45m of technical content a day.
- **Reading** (5-10m at the gym): It so happens that my resting time between sets at the gym is around the same time I read a page of a technical book.

This is my routine! It is most likely not the exact same as yours. So it's your responsability to figure out when and how you can fit a couple of minutes to study something.

If it's 3-4 hours a day? That's awesome. If that's only 15m, you better find the best resource out there so you don't waste it. But find time to study.

- Postgraduate course in Software Engineering ‚Äì Commute, maybe a bit at work.
- The Pragmatic Programmer ‚Äì Between sets at the gym.

### Q3: Exploring new languages and Cloud

- **AWS, Go, Kotlin** ‚Äì Hands-on at work.
- Postgraduate course in Software Engineering ‚Äì Commute, maybe a bit at work.
- Designing Data-Intensive Applications ‚Äì Between sets at the gym.

### Q4: More work on Cloud and some NoSQL

## Why I‚Äôm Sharing This

That's something you may ask.

If you do, I would first recommend you take a look at this article: [Why a Blob](/blog/why-a-blog).

If that is not enough, I'm sharing this for

- **Accountability** ‚Äì Writing it down and sharing it makes me more committed to sticking with the plan.
- **Motivation** - Maybe you just needed to see someone else planning their learning roadmap to begin planning yours.
- **Community** ‚Äì I‚Äôd love to hear from you! What‚Äôs your learning roadmap for 2025? What skills are you focusing on? Let‚Äôs exchange insights on [**LinkedIn!**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/douglas-rocha-leite)!

Let‚Äôs grow together this year. üöÄ
