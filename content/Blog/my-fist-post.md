Hello there!

Well, beginnings are always a bit akward, aren't they?

This post is mainly supposed to just exist, just be the first milestone of this blog and to make sure it exists.

I really hope this turns out well. I hope everyone can benefit from this ackward endeavor of mine to build a blog.

Stay around with me and see where this goes.
