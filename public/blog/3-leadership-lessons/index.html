What I didn’t realize was how much I had to learn—fast. Leadership isn’t just about being good at your craft; it’s about navigating a whole new set of responsibilities, many of which no one prepares you for.\nIn just one week, I ran into multiple leadership challenges that completely shifted my perspective. Here are some of the most important lessons I learned—lessons I wish someone had told me earlier.\n1. You Are the Interface Between Your Team and the Corporate World As a developer, my focus was on writing clean, efficient code. My responsibilities were clear: build features, fix bugs, and optimize performance. But as a leader, I quickly realized that my job now involved much more than just technical execution.\nIn just a few days, I had to:\nPlan the onboarding of a new team member Relay an HR request to someone on my team Schedule and facilitate meetings with other departments to align on action plans These tasks had nothing to do with coding, yet they were essential for keeping the team running smoothly. A leader isn’t just responsible for their own work; they ensure the entire team has the support, clarity, and resources needed to succeed.\n2. You Have to Hold Your Team Accountable One of the hardest realizations was that being a good leader sometimes means pushing your team—especially when it comes to accountability.\nIn the last sprint, I made the mistake of assuming that tasks were progressing smoothly without actively checking in. I didn’t enforce deadlines, and I didn’t ensure that performance metrics were being tracked consistently.\nThe result? The burndown chart wasn’t where it should have been, the sprint looked delayed, and our PM wasn’t happy. I got called out for not addressing these issues sooner.\nIt’s not about micromanaging—it’s about making sure the team stays aligned and accountable. A leader who avoids difficult conversations or assumes everything is fine without verification is setting their team up for failure.\n3. Reporting Becomes a Major Part of Your Job Developers often complain about reporting their tasks in daily stand-ups. But let me tell you—if you think that’s frustrating, try being the one responsible for communicating your entire team’s progress to upper management.\nI quickly learned that effective reporting is an art. You need to:\nGather relevant updates from your team Filter out unnecessary details Present the information concisely and clearly to stakeholders Too much information, and you overwhelm people. Too little, and they start asking questions you should’ve anticipated. Striking the right balance takes practice, but it’s a crucial skill for any leader.\nNo one told me these things before I became a leader—but I wish they had. Leadership isn’t just about knowing more than your team or making technical decisions. It’s about ensuring your team operates efficiently, stays accountable, and communicates effectively with the rest of the company.\nThe learning curve is steep, but every challenge comes with a new lesson. And honestly? I’m enjoying every bit of it.\nIf you’re stepping into a leadership role (or thinking about it), know this: you’ll be learning on the go. And that’s okay.\nI’ll keep sharing my journey here—because I’m sure there are many more lessons ahead.\nFor more insights, software development and productivity content, follow up for more posts here in my blog and let us connect in LinkedIn!\n","wordCount":"570","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/images/cool-setup-006.jpg","datePublished":"2025-03-12T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-03-12T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Douglas"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/blog/3-leadership-lessons/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"DouglasDev","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/images/code-icon.png"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/blog/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/projects/ title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li><li><a href=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/contact/ title=Contact><span>Contact</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/blog/>Blogs</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Lessons I Learned About Leadership (That No One Told Me)</h1><div class=post-description>3 Leadership Lessons that can help new leaders</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-03-12 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>March 12, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;570 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Douglas</div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=eager src=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/images/cool-setup-006.jpg alt="Cool Setup"><p>Unfortunetly not my setup</p></figure><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1-you-are-the-interface-between-your-team-and-the-corporate-world>1.
