Yeah, dark times.\nBut aside from that, I used to write poems as a teenager (never shared them, though), fiction as a kid, and I loved crafting DnD campaigns in my early 20s.\nTechnical writing found me around 2022, when I was trying to break into Data Science and everyone kept saying, “You need a Medium blog to share what you learn.”\nWell… I’m not a Data Scientist.\nInstead, I got into Software Engineering (I have a bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering), and I love it. But that writing idea stuck with me.\nI tried going back to Medium with some articles, but it didn’t really work out. Then I started writing quick posts on LinkedIn, and I genuinely enjoyed it. Now, I want to take the next step.\nWhy a Website? I could skip this entire section and just tell you to watch this Ali Abdaal video.\nBut I’ll give you my take as well—it’ll be quicker than watching the whole thing.\nAccording to Ali Abdaal, a productivity YouTuber I’ve been following for a while, having a personal website serves three main purposes:\n1 - Personal CV First, it works as a personal CV—a place to showcase your work and tell your story. It may sound similar to a well-optimized LinkedIn profile, and in some ways, it is. But it’s also so much more.\nYour website lets you share projects, ideas, and experiences in ways LinkedIn or a PDF résumé never could.\nWhen companies hire, they don’t just care about your professional achievements—they care about you. And a Personal Website is a perfect way to tell them about you.\nBut most importantly, even if none of that mattered, having a personal website makes you stand out from the competition.\n2 - Personal Branding A website is your playground. You can shape your own About Me page, add pictures, write blog posts—whatever reflects your personality and expertise. It’s the perfect foundation for building your personal brand.\n3 - The Lucky Magnet Putting yourself out there increases your chances of attracting unexpected opportunities.\nNothing just falls into your lap—but something might fall into your website.\nWhy a Blog? Technically, I didn’t have to start a blog to get the benefits of a personal website.\nBut I wanted to.\nI needed a space to share knowledge and put all these ideas running through my mind out into the world.\nYes, it helps with personal branding. But more than that, it satisfies my urge to write.\nHow? I’ve written a lot about why I started this blog. But if I’m being honest, about 50% of the motivation was just to test out Hugo.\nI’d heard about this Golang-based tool that generates static web pages from Markdown files, and I had to try it. Golang is on my to-learn list (somewhere around #54), so I figured I’d kill two birds with one stone.\nI built everything using this video as a guide: How to build a portfolio website. However, I prefer Vercel over Hostinger, so I deployed it here instead.\nIf you watch the tutorial, you’ll see that you don’t actually need to know any Go—so yeah, I’ll still need to get around to learning it someday.\nWhat to Expect from This Blog? Content. Lots of content.\nI love writing, and I hope this space gives me even more opportunities to do so.\nI’ll mostly write about software—that’s my biggest passion, right after God and my amazing wife. Some of my posts will be technical and advanced, but I’ll also aim to share knowledge for beginners, enthusiasts, and professionals alike.\nBeyond software, I’ve been diving into productivity and organization this year (2024–2025, for those reading this later).\nI’m also learning about management, hoping to climb a few steps in my career, so I may write about that too.\nMore than anything, this blog will be a more structured, audience-focused version of my Second Brain.\nWhy You? So far, I’ve talked a lot about why I created this personal website. But why should you create one?\nWell, Ali Abdaal explains it better than I ever could. And I genuinely believe in everything he says.\nBut most importantly, you should just start something.\nStop overthinking, stop dreaming about it—just do it, even if it’s not exactly what you envisioned.\nIt took me about an hour to set this up once I found the right tutorial. Try it yourself. See how easy it is to put something out there when you want to.\nYou’ll see how empowering it can be.\nStay Connected! If you enjoyed this article, there’s a lot more coming! I’ll be sharing insights on software development, productivity and career growth—so stick around.\nFollow the blog to stay updated with new posts. Connect with me on LinkedIn for discussions, quick insights and networking. Let’s build great things together!\n","wordCount":"829","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/blog/why-a-blog/images/hugo-seeklogo.png","datePublished":"2025-02-04T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-02-04T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Douglas"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/blog/why-a-blog/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"DouglasDev","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/images/code-icon.png"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/blog/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/projects/ title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li><li><a href=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/contact/ title=Contact><span>Contact</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/blog/>Blogs</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Why a Blog?</h1><div class=post-description>Why I created this blog</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-02-04 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 4, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;829 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Douglas</div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=eager src=https://douglas-rocha-dev.vercel.app/images/hugo-seeklogo.png alt="Hugo Logo"><p>Hugo Logo</p></figure><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#why-a-website><strong>Why a Website?</strong></a><ul><li><a href=#1---personal-cv><strong>1 - Personal CV</strong></a></li><li><a href=#2---personal-branding><strong>2 - Personal Branding</strong></a></li><li><a href=#3---the-lucky-magnet><strong>3 - The Lucky Magnet</strong></a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#why-a-blog><strong>Why a Blog?</strong></a></li><li><a href=#how><strong>How?</strong></a></li><li><a href=#what-to-expect-from-this-blog><strong>What to Expect from This Blog?</strong></a></li><li><a href=#why-you><strong>Why You?</strong></a></li><li><a href=#stay-connected>Stay Connected!</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>I’ve always been a writer—well, except for that one time in freshman year when my teacher gave me a 3 out of 10 in an essay.
